Sudoku
======

This repository contains some code I wrote for solving sudokus in different
ways, most notably various Monte-Carlo solvers. It also holds a set of notes (in
German) that I collected about enumerations of sudokus and solutions and about
different ways to solve solutions.

It containsh a library with

* a sudoku class
* an ordinary backtracking solver (works well)
* a bunch of Monte Carlo solvers (most of them work well)
* a Nelder-Mead solver (doesn't work well)

Also a bit of experimental matlab code

* a Newton method solver (doesn't work well)
* a quadratic programming solver (incomplete)
